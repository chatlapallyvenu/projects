// Create a Simple Calculator using Conditions
// Steps :

// 2. Ask the user to enter the operation (+, -, *, /).
// 3. Ask the user to enter the second number.
// 4. Based on the operation entered:
// 5. If it's addition (+), add the two numbers together.
// 6. If it's subtraction (-), subtract the second number from the first number.
// 7. If it's multiplication (*), multiply the two numbers together.
// 8. If it's division (/), divide the first number by the second number.
// 9. Display the result of the operation.


let number1=5;
let operator = prompt("enter the operator:")
let number2=8;

if
(operator == "+")

{
   console.log(number1+number2)
}
else if (operator == "-")
{
   console.log(number1-number2)
}
else if (operator == "*")
{
   console.log(number1*number2)
}
else if (operator == "/")
{
   console.log(number1/number2)
}
